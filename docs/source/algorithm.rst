gRNA scoring
------------
The gRNAs score is computed from three weights that aims to (1) maximize specifcity, (2) minimize cut-to-insert distance and (3) avoid cutting near splice junctions and 5â€™ UTRs.

Recoding strategy
-----------------
| Silent mutations are included in the DNA donor to:
| - Prevent the edited genome from being recut. 
| - Facilitate payload insertion when the cut-to-insert distance is inevitably large.  
| There are three recoding intesities: "full", "prevent recut", and "none". 
| In "full", the cut-to-insert region is recoded to facilitate payload insertion. The gRNA and split gRNA (disrupted by the payload, creating a protopsacer-half and a PAM-PAM) are also recoded.
| The "prevent recut" intensity differs from "full" by the lack of recoding in the cut-to-insert region

DNA donor processing strategy
-----------------------------
| After recoding, the DNA donors are further processed, in a type-specific way.
| There are two types of DNA donors:
| - Double-stranded DNA(dsDNA) 
| - Single-stranded oligonucleotides(ssODN)
