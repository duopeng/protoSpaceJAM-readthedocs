gRNA scoring
------------
The gRNAs score is computed from three weights that aims to (1) maximize specifcity, (2) minimize cut-to-insert distance and (3) avoid cutting near splice junctions and 5â€™ UTRs.

Recoding strategy
-----------------
Silent mutations are included in the DNA donor to (1) prevent the edited genome from being recut and (2) facilitate payload insertion when the cut-to-insert distance is inevitably large.  
|There are three recoding intesities: full, prevent recut, and none. 
|
In full recoding, the cut-to-insert region is recoded to facilitate payload insertion. The gRNA and split gRNA (payload homology arm chimeric region) are recoded 
|The prevent recut intensity differs from full by the lack of recoding in the cut-to-insert region
